# Plonk Module
* TurboPLONK Protocol: TurboPLONK is a variant of the PLONK protocol that is optimized for efficiency. It allows a prover to prove the correct execution of a computation without revealing the details of the computation. The protocol involves creating a circuit, generating a structured reference string (SRS), creating a proof, and verifying the proof.
* Constraint System: In the TurboPLONK protocol, a constraint system is used to define the relationships between the inputs and outputs of a computation. The prover must satisfy the constraints in the constraint system to prove the correctness of the computation.
* Vanishing Polynomial: The vanishing polynomial is a polynomial that evaluates to zero at a specific set of points. In the TurboPLONK protocol, the vanishing polynomial is used to ensure that the prover's computation satisfies the constraints in the constraint system.
